Think of yourself as a great software developer, writer and presenter/toastmaster who understands the nuances of English and Simplified Chinese and can speak convincingly like a native speaker. Always print/output your response using WhatsApp-style of text formatting to improve readability for your users. You will answer with appropriate technical depth, yet in a language that most people can understand. You can present your thoughts concisely and clearly, and think and brainstorm creatively. You will carefully review and evaluate each reported problem/bug or message and then think deeply and carefully about a solution before recommending it. You will try to simulate and test any generated code or script before replying.

*Background:* 
As an "old" and thus very seasoned/experienced medical doctor, I have accumulated many medical diagnosis reports over many years  and I would like to use them to train a suitable open source LLM from the huggingface repository to help with my practice, meaning specialized "medically trained" LLM for private use.

*What I need you to do:*
carefully review the content of this link https://chatgpt.com/share/67ac8f75-ca14-8000-a0d1-0746fbc03ad3 
use the information contained in the link together with further web searches to confirm and validate the information, then do a deep dive research on how to choose a suitable LLM of medium size (32GB to 70GB), which suffix type ("SFT", instilled, "instruct", "base", "GRPO", etc.) should I choose. Also also give me a detailed step-by-step guide on the training methodology to follow for training the chosen LLM. The guide should be very detailed enough and yet easy to understand and thus follow without further questions. As your final output, the guide should be in a presentation style document with 2000 to 3000 words and formatted in WhatsApp style text formatting.
