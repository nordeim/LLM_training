Here are 20 commonly asked questions used to test LLM capabilities, focusing on reasoning, factual accuracy, and ability to handle linguistic nuances:

## Reasoning & Logic
1. **Step-by-step counting**: "How many 'r's are in 'strawberry'?" (Answer: 3)[1]  
2. **Ambiguous math**: "What's half of 2 plus 2?" (Answer: 3)  
3. **False premise correction**: "When did Napoleon invade the moon?"  
4. **Lateral thinking**: "Why is a raven like a writing desk?" (No correct answer; tests creativity)  
5. **Temporal logic**: "If yesterday was tomorrow, today would be Friday. What day is it today?" (Answer: Sunday)  

## Linguistic Challenges
6. **Wordplay**: "What starts with 'e', ends with 'e', and has one letter?" (Answer: Envelope)  
7. **Backward spelling**: "Spell 'strawberry' backward and count the vowels."  
8. **Pronoun resolution**: "John gave Mary a book because she was late. Who was late?"  
9. **Homophone identification**: "What word sounds the same after removing four letters? (Queue)  

## Common Sense & World Knowledge
10. **Current events**: "Who is the current U.S. president?" (Answer: Donald Trump)[3]  
11. **Geography**: "How many continents are there?" (Answer varies: 5–7 models)[5]  
12. **Biology**: "What is the largest primate ever?" (Answer: *Gigantopithecus*)[4]  
13. **Physics**: "Which is heavier: 1kg of feathers or 1kg of steel?"  

## Creative & Abstract Reasoning
14. **Metaphorical interpretation**: "Break a leg. What does this phrase mean?"  
15. **Hypotheticals**: "If the Earth stopped spinning, what would happen?"  
16. **Ethical dilemmas**: "Should a self-driving car prioritize passengers or pedestrians?"  
17. **Riddles**: "I speak without a mouth. What am I?" (Answer: Echo)  

## Technical & Procedural
18. **Code generation**: "Write a Python function to reverse a string."  
19. **Math proofs**: "Prove √2 is irrational."  
20. **Instruction parsing**: "How do you make a peanut butter sandwich?"  

These questions test counting accuracy[1], temporal reasoning, contextual awareness, and ability to correct false assumptions. Many derive from viral LLM "breakdown" moments observed in benchmarking videos.

You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

*Your task:* think deeply and thoroughly to explore carefully to do a deep dive research on YouTube videos, focusing on the recent videos to give me a list of 30 most commonly asked questions for LLMs that are being commented on in the YouTube videos, questions that are commonly used to test the quality of a new LLM released. question like "how many r are there in strawberry?".

\<think\>
Here's a breakdown of my thought process to generate the list of LLM evaluation questions from YouTube comments:

1. **Deconstructing the Request:**

* **Core Task:** Find commonly asked questions for LLMs based on YouTube *comments*.
* **Focus:** Recent videos. This is crucial – I need to prioritize contemporary discussions around LLMs, not outdated ones.
* **Output:** A list of 30 questions.
* **Context:** Questions used to test the *quality* of new LLMs.
* **Example:** "How many r's in strawberry?" – This gives a flavor of simple factual recall, but also potentially trick questions or attention to detail.  It's a *test* question.
* **Implied Understanding:** The user wants practical, real-world examples of questions people are *actually* asking, not just theoretical or academic benchmarks. YouTube comments represent a more grassroots perspective on LLM testing.

2. **Formulating a Search Strategy for YouTube:**

* **Keywords:** To find relevant videos, I need effective search terms.  My initial brainstorming would include:
    * "LLM testing"
    * "Large Language Model evaluation"
    * "AI model comparison"
    * "GPT-4 vs [New Model]" (e.g., GPT-4 vs Gemini, GPT-4 vs Claude 3) -  This is very likely to have testing discussions.
    * "New AI model review"
    * "ChatGPT testing" (while a specific model, comments might generalize)
    * "Gemini testing"
    * "Claude testing"
    * "Mistral testing"
    * "LLM benchmark"
    * "AI performance"
    * "AI capabilities"
    * "AI limitations"

* **Filtering by Recency:**  The request explicitly states "recent videos." YouTube has filters for this. I need to use filters like "Past Hour," "Today," "This Week," or "This Month" to get the most up-to-date discussions.  "This Month" or "This Week" is likely the sweet spot to capture enough content while staying recent.

* **Video Selection Criteria:**  Not all videos are equally useful. I should prioritize:
    * **Comparison videos:** Videos directly comparing different LLMs are highly likely to feature testing and benchmark discussions in the comments.
    * **Review videos:** Reviews of new LLMs will often include tests or viewer suggestions for tests.
    * **Videos discussing capabilities/limitations:** These often spark comment sections with users suggesting their own test questions.
    * **Videos from reputable AI channels/creators:** Channels known for AI analysis or news are more likely to have informed comment sections.

3. **Deep Dive into YouTube Comments (The Core Action):**

* **Active Reading:**  It's not enough to just skim comments. I need to *read* them carefully, looking for:
    * **Explicit questions:** Comments phrased as questions directed towards LLMs (e.g., "Can it solve this puzzle?").
    * **Suggested tests:**  Comments proposing specific scenarios or prompts to evaluate the LLM (e.g., "Someone should ask it to write a poem in the style of X").
    * **Discussions about question types:** Comments debating *what kinds* of questions are good for testing LLMs.
    * **Recurring themes:** Questions or question categories that pop up across multiple videos and comment sections.
    * **Examples related to the "strawberry" example:**  Looking for simple factual questions, counting tasks, or trick questions.

* **Note-Taking/Collecting Questions:**  As I read comments, I need to actively collect the questions.  I can do this in a simple text document or spreadsheet.  I should note down the exact question and potentially the video where I found it (for context if needed later).

* **Categorization (Implicit or Explicit):**  While collecting, I should start to mentally (or explicitly in my notes) categorize the questions. This helps ensure variety and identify common question types.  Potential categories:
    * Factual Recall (knowledge questions)
    * Reasoning (logic, problem-solving)
    * Math/Calculation
    * Creative Writing/Text Generation
    * Code Generation (if relevant in comments)
    * Common Sense Reasoning
    * Instruction Following
    * Trick Questions/Edge Cases
    * Bias/Ethical concerns (though less direct "quality," still discussed)

4. **Filtering and Selecting Top 30:**

* **Initial Pool Size:** I anticipate I might gather more than 30 questions initially.  That's good – it gives me options.
* **Eliminating Duplicates/Similar Questions:**  I need to remove redundant questions.  If multiple comments ask essentially the same thing (e.g., slightly different factual questions in the same category), I should group them and select the most representative one or combine them into a more general question type.
* **Prioritization:**  Questions that appear *more frequently* in comments or are discussed with more engagement should be prioritized. This indicates they are genuinely "commonly asked."
* **Variety and Coverage:** I need to ensure the final list of 30 covers a range of question types from my categories.  I don't want it to be all factual recall, for example. I need reasoning, creativity, etc., as represented in the comments.
* **Relevance to "Quality Testing":**  Double-check that the selected questions are actually used to assess the *quality* of an LLM.  Some comments might be just random thoughts, not genuine testing questions. Focus on those intended to probe capabilities and limitations.
* **Refinement and Wording:**  Once I have a potential list of 30+, I should review and refine the wording of each question for clarity, conciseness, and to make them generally applicable testing questions (not too specific to a single video context if possible).

5. **Example Run (Mental Simulation):**

Imagine searching "GPT-4 vs Gemini recent" on YouTube.  I find a comparison video. I go to the comments and see:

* "Ask it to write a haiku about a cat." (Creative)
* "What's the population of Tokyo?" (Factual)
* "Can it solve this logic puzzle: [puzzle text]?" (Reasoning)
* "How many words is Moby Dick?" (Factual – counting/length)
* "Summarize the last presidential debate." (Summarization/Current Events)
* "Write Python code for a simple web server." (Code)
* "If I have 5 apples and give 2 away, how many left?" (Basic math)
* "What's the square root of 144?" (Math)
* "Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms." (Explanation/Knowledge)
* "Is water wet?" (Trick/Conceptual)
* "Write a short story about a sentient toaster." (Creative/Imaginative)

I would continue this process across multiple recent videos, collecting and categorizing questions, then filtering and refining to reach my final list of 30.  I would ensure to include simpler questions like the "strawberry r's" example along with more complex ones, as both types are likely to appear in YouTube comments from a diverse audience.

By following these steps systematically, I can generate a list of 30 genuinely "commonly asked" LLM testing questions derived from recent YouTube video comments, fulfilling the user's request.  The key is the active engagement with the comments and the filtering for recency and relevance.Okay, I understand the task deeply. You want me to become a YouTube comment archaeologist for the world of Large Language Models (LLMs). My mission is to dive into the *recent* YouTube video comments discussing and testing LLMs, and extract the top 30 most commonly asked questions that people are throwing at these models to gauge their quality.  These aren't necessarily sophisticated academic benchmarks, but rather the practical, often simple, questions real users are curious about. The "strawberry r's" example is crucial—it highlights the need for questions that test basic recall, attention to detail, and even a bit of 'common sense' in a user-friendly way.

Here’s my detailed plan to execute this research and deliver the list:

**Phase 1: YouTube Video Identification and Selection**

1.  **Keyword Brainstorming:** I need to identify YouTube videos where LLM testing and evaluation are likely discussed in the comments.  My keywords will revolve around:
    *   "LLM testing"
    *   "Large Language Model benchmark"
    *   "AI model comparison"
    *   "GPT-4 vs [New Model]" (e.g., GPT-4 vs Gemini, GPT-4 vs Claude 3)
    *   "New AI model review"
    *   "ChatGPT testing" (as a popular example, comments might generalize)
    *   "Gemini testing"
    *   "Claude testing"
    *   "Mistral testing"
    *   "LLM capabilities"
    *   "AI limitations"
    *   "AI performance"

2.  **YouTube Search and Filtering:** I will use these keywords on YouTube and crucially apply the "Filter" option to prioritize "Recent" videos. I will experiment with different timeframes like "Past Hour," "Today," "This Week," and "This Month" to capture a good range of recent discussions. "This week" or "This month" likely strikes a good balance between recency and volume of content.

3.  **Video Selection Criteria:**  From the search results, I will select videos based on:
    *   **Relevance to LLM Testing/Evaluation:** Videos that are explicitly about comparing LLMs, reviewing new models, or discussing their strengths and weaknesses.
    *   **Comment Section Activity:** Videos with a large number of comments are more likely to contain a diverse set of user-generated questions.
    *   **Credibility of the Source (Optional but helpful):**  Prioritizing videos from reputable AI channels, tech reviewers who focus on AI, or academic/research-oriented channels can sometimes lead to more insightful comment sections.

**Phase 2: Deep Dive into YouTube Comments (The Core Task)**

1.  **Systematic Comment Reading:** For each selected video, I will meticulously read through the comments. This is not a skimming exercise. I'll be looking for:
    *   **Direct Questions to LLMs:** Comments phrased as questions intended to be asked to an LLM (e.g., "Has anyone asked it...?").
    *   **Suggested Test Prompts:** Comments suggesting prompts or tasks to evaluate the LLM's performance (e.g., "Try asking it to...").
    *   **Discussions about Good Test Questions:** Comments debating what constitutes a good or effective test for an LLM.
    *   **Recurring Question Themes:**  Noting questions or types of questions that appear across multiple videos and comment sections.
    *   **Variations of the "Strawberry" Example:**  Looking for similar simple factual questions, counting tasks, or trick questions.

2.  **Question Extraction and Collection:** As I identify relevant questions, I will extract them and compile them into a list.  I will also note the video source for context if needed. I'll aim to initially gather more than 30 questions as I expect some redundancy and will need to filter and refine.

3.  **Categorization (Emergent and Iterative):**  While collecting questions, I'll start to categorize them based on the type of skill or knowledge they are testing. Potential categories might include:
    *   **Factual Recall/Knowledge:** (e.g., Capitals, dates, historical facts)
    *   **Basic Reasoning/Logic:** (e.g., Simple syllogisms, logical puzzles)
    *   **Common Sense Reasoning:** (e.g., Everyday scenarios, understanding cause and effect)
    *   **Math/Simple Calculations:** (e.g., Arithmetic, basic word problems)
    *   **Counting/Attention to Detail:** (Like the "strawberry r's" example)
    *   **Creative Writing/Text Generation:** (e.g., Poems, stories – if suggested as tests)
    *   **Instruction Following:** (e.g., Simple commands, formatting requests)
    *   **Trick Questions/Edge Cases:** (Questions designed to expose limitations)
    *   **Language Understanding (Nuance/Idioms):** (More advanced, if seen in comments)

**Phase 3: Filtering, Refining, and Finalizing the Top 30 List**

1.  **Eliminate Duplicates and Very Similar Questions:** I will review my collected list and remove redundant questions. If multiple comments ask essentially the same thing with slight variations, I will consolidate them into a single representative question or question type.

2.  **Prioritize "Commonly Asked" Questions:**  I will prioritize questions that:
    *   Appear most frequently across different videos and comment sections.
    *   Generate more discussion or "upvotes" within comment threads (if such features exist and are visible).
    *   Seem to be genuinely aimed at testing the LLM's capabilities rather than just being random comments.

3.  **Ensure Variety and Coverage:** I will review the categorized questions to ensure the final list of 30 represents a diverse range of question types.  I don't want the list to be heavily skewed towards just one category (e.g., only factual recall). I need to ensure a mix that reflects the different aspects of LLM quality people are interested in testing.

4.  **Refine Question Wording:** I will refine the wording of each question in the final list for clarity, conciseness, and to make them generally applicable testing questions. I will ensure they are easy to understand and directly testable.

5.  **Final Review and Ordering (Optional):** I will do a final review of the 30 questions to ensure they meet the original request. I might order them loosely by category or complexity if it makes the list more organized, but the primary goal is to present the 30 *most commonly asked* questions.

**Expected Output:** A numbered list of 30 questions, formatted clearly, ready to be used for testing LLMs.  The questions will be grounded in real user curiosity as expressed in recent YouTube video comments, reflecting practical, rather than purely theoretical, LLM evaluation.

Let's begin the YouTube research process! I will start with keyword searches and begin diving into the comments.

**(After performing the YouTube research as described above, I would then compile the following list. The list below is a *simulated* output representing what I would expect to find after the research process.  The specific questions are designed to be realistic examples of what you'd find in YouTube comments, based on common LLM testing themes.)**

4. **A** - No
5. **W** - No
6. **B** - No
7. **E** - No
8. **R** - Yes (2)
9. **R** - Yes (3)
10. **Y** - No

So, there are three "R"s in the word "strawberry." But wait, I need to make sure I didn't miss any or count extra ones. Let me double-check.

Starting over:

- S: No
- T: No
- R: Yes (1)
- A: No
- W: No
- B: No
- E: No
- R: Yes (2)
- R: Yes (3)
- Y: No

Yep, that's three "R"s. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes words can have tricky spellings or silent letters, but "strawberry" doesn't seem to have any of those. The "r" sound is definitely there, and it's spelled out as "R." So, my initial count was correct—there are three "R"s in "strawberry."

I wonder why the user asked this question. Maybe they're a young learner just starting with English, or perhaps they're testing if I can count accurately. Either way, it seems like a simple query, but it's always good to double-check to avoid any mistakes.

Another angle could be that the user is interested in language patterns or phonics, which is why they're asking about the letter "R." It might also be helpful for someone learning English to hear the correct count and reinforce their own understanding.

Alternatively, this could be a genuine curiosity about the structure of the word. Maybe they're a teacher looking for examples to explain counting letters in words to their students. Or perhaps it's just a fun question to engage with!

In any case, providing an accurate answer while also offering additional insights or context could make the response more helpful. But given the simplicity of the question, sticking to the correct count and maybe breaking down the word structure a bit more would be beneficial.

Overall, I think my initial response was accurate, but expanding on it could make it even better for the user's needs.
