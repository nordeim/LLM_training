### 2. Prerequisites & Environment Setup

‚úÖ **Hardware & Software Requirements:**  
- Python 3.8+  
- GPU-enabled machine (local GPU or cloud instances on AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- PyTorch (v1.12+ recommended)  
- Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets libraries  
- Additional packages: `accelerate`, `peft`, and `wandb` for logging and tracking experiments.

# Install required packages (run in terminal)
# pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate peft wandb

import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, TrainingArguments, Trainer
from datasets import load_dataset

# Check for GPU availability
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
print(f"Using device: {device}")
```

‚úÖ **Setting Up Experiment Tracking:**  
We recommend using Weights & Biases (wandb) to track training metrics.

```python
import wandb
wandb.login()  # Follow prompt to log in with your API key
```

### 3. Data Collection & Preprocessing

üí° **Data Requirements:**  
For a medical diagnosis LLM, use high-quality, curated datasets such as PubMed abstracts, clinical guidelines, and curated medical Q&A datasets. Ensure data diversity and representation across conditions and demographics.

üí° **Data Preprocessing Steps:**  
1. **Cleaning & Normalization:** Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and normalize text.
2. **Tokenization:** Use Hugging Face‚Äôs tokenizer to convert text to tokens.
3. **Formatting:** Create prompt templates that include instructions, input context, and expected responses.

‚úÖ **Example Code for Data Loading and Preprocessing:**

```python
# Load a sample medical dataset from Hugging Face (replace with your curated dataset)
dataset = load_dataset("your-medical-dataset", split="train")

# Define a prompt template for medical diagnosis Q&A
prompt_template = (
    "### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert. Provide a concise and accurate diagnosis based on the following patient data.\n\n"
    "### Patient Data:\n{patient_data}\n\n"
    "### Diagnosis:"
)

def preprocess_function(examples):
    # Combine patient data into the prompt template
    prompts = [prompt_template.format(patient_data=ex) for ex in examples["text"]]
    return {"prompt": prompts}

# Apply the preprocessing to the dataset
processed_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
print(processed_dataset[0])
```

üí° **Advanced Data Augmentation:**  
For better model performance, consider techniques such as synonym replacement, back-translation, or controlled data augmentation to expand the dataset without sacrificing quality.

### 4. Selecting & Loading a Pre-trained Model

üí° **Model Selection:**  
Choosing a pre-trained model that has been trained on a diverse corpus (such as BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, or Llama variants) provides a strong foundation. For our example, we select a Llama-based model available on Hugging Face and adapt it for the medical domain.

‚úÖ **Example Code to Load the Model and Tokenizer:**

```python
model_name = "huggingface/llama-base-medical"  # Replace with a suitable model from HF Hub
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name).to(device)

# Print model summary
print(model.config)
```

üí° **Note:**  
For domain adaptation, you might further pretrain the model on additional medical corpora before fine-tuning.

### 5. Fine-tuning the LLM on Medical Data

üí° **Fine-tuning Overview:**  
Fine-tuning adjusts the pre-trained weights to better reflect domain-specific language. Key aspects include:  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, sequence length.  
- **PEFT/LoRA Techniques:** Use low-rank adaptation to reduce memory overhead without sacrificing performance.

‚úÖ **Integrating LoRA for Efficient Fine-tuning:**

```python
from peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig

# Define LoRA configuration
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=16,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none"
)

# Wrap the model with LoRA
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
print("Model wrapped with LoRA adapters.")
```

‚úÖ **Preparing Training Arguments:**

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./medical_llm_finetuned",
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,    # Adjust based on GPU memory
    per_device_eval_batch_size=2,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    warmup_steps=100,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    logging_steps=50,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    fp16=True,                        # Use fp16 if supported for speed
    report_to="wandb"
)
```

‚úÖ **Training with the Trainer API:**

```python
# Define a data collator to handle padding dynamically
from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer, mlm=False)

# Create the Trainer instance
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=processed_dataset,
    eval_dataset=processed_dataset,  # In practice, use a separate validation set
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator
)

# Start fine-tuning
trainer.train()
```

üí° **Tips for Fine-tuning:**  
- Monitor loss and evaluation metrics to prevent overfitting.  
- Use early stopping if necessary.  
- Save checkpoints frequently.

### 6. Evaluation & Metrics

üí° **Evaluation Strategy:**  
Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance using domain-specific metrics such as diagnostic accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. Additionally, qualitative assessments by medical experts can ensure clinical relevance.

‚úÖ **Code Sample for Model Evaluation:**

```python
# Define a function to generate a diagnosis given patient data
def generate_diagnosis(patient_data):
    prompt = prompt_template.format(patient_data=patient_data)
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_new_tokens=100)
    diagnosis = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return diagnosis

# Example patient data (sample text)
sample_patient_data = "Patient exhibits fever, cough, and shortness of breath with abnormal chest X-ray findings."
diagnosis = generate_diagnosis(sample_patient_data)
print("Generated Diagnosis:", diagnosis)
```

üí° **Quantitative Evaluation:**  
After generating responses on a held-out validation set, calculate metrics such as accuracy and F1 scores. For example:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score

# Assume you have lists of true labels and predictions (this is domain-specific)
true_labels = [1, 0, 1, 1]  # Dummy labels for illustration
predictions = [1, 0, 0, 1]  # Dummy predictions

accuracy = accuracy_score(true_labels, predictions)
f1 = f1_score(true_labels, predictions, average='weighted')

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}, F1 Score: {f1:.2f}")
```

---

### 7. Deployment & Integration

üí° **Deployment Options:**  
Once fine-tuned, the model can be deployed in a secure, scalable environment for clinical use. Options include:  
- **Cloud-based APIs:** Deploy using services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.  
- **Local Inference:** Convert the model into optimized formats (e.g., GGUF) for on-premise deployment.  
- **Integration with Clinical Systems:** Embed the model within clinical decision support systems ensuring HIPAA and GDPR compliance.

‚úÖ **Example Code to Save and Push the Model to Hugging Face Hub:**

```python
# Save the fine-tuned model locally
model.save_pretrained("./medical_llm_finetuned")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./medical_llm_finetuned")

# Push the model to Hugging Face Hub (requires authentication)
model.push_to_hub("your_username/medical-llm-diagnosis")
tokenizer.push_to_hub("your_username/medical-llm-diagnosis")
```

‚úÖ **Deploying via FastAPI (Simple REST API Example):**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/diagnose")
async def diagnose(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    patient_data = data.get("patient_data", "")
    prompt = prompt_template.format(patient_data=patient_data)
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
    outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_new_tokens=100)
    diagnosis = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return {"diagnosis": diagnosis}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

This REST API can be containerized and deployed to cloud platforms for real-time inference.
