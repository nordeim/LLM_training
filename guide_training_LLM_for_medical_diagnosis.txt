To train an open source language model (LLM) from the Hugging Face repository for medical diagnosis, you can follow these structured steps. This guide includes Python code samples that enable you to get started efficiently.

### Step 1: Environment Setup

First, ensure you have Python (3.6 or later) installed along with necessary libraries. Install the `transformers`, `datasets`, and `torch` libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch
```

### Step 2: Choosing a Model

Visit the Hugging Face Model Hub and select a suitable pre-trained LLM for medical tasks (e.g., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, or similar). You can start with an available model that has been trained on biomedical texts for better performance in the medical domain.

### Step 3: Data Collection and Preprocessing

Gather medical datasets for training. For instance, datasets like MIMIC-III or PubMed abstracts can be useful. Preprocess your data into a suitable format: usually a CSV or JSON file containing pairs of prompts and expected responses.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('medical_dataset.csv')
print(data.head())
```

### Step 4: Tokenization

Tokenize the dataset using the tokenizer associated with your chosen model:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('model_name')

def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = datasets.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
```

### Step 5: Model Configuration

Configure your model for fine-tuning. Depending on your task (like question-answering or text generation), load the corresponding pre-trained model:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('model_name', num_labels=2)
```

### Step 6: Training the Model

Define your training arguments and use the Trainer API from Hugging Face. Adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epoch count for optimal results.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model
