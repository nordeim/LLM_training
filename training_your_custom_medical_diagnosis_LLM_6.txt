# Guide to help you fine-tune a medical LLM for your practice

**Choosing the Right LLM**

*Size Matters (But Not Too Much)*: You're on the right track with the 32GB-70GB range. This offers a good balance between performance and computational cost.  Models in this range can capture complex relationships in your data without requiring massive infrastructure[3].

*Suffix Types: Decoding the Alphabet Soup*:

*   _"Base"_ : This is the raw, pre-trained model.  It hasn't been fine-tuned for specific tasks[6].  You generally wouldn't use this directly.
*   _"Instruct" or "SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)"_: These models have been fine-tuned on instruction-following datasets.  This means they are better at understanding and responding to prompts[2][3].  An "instruct" or SFT model is a strong starting point for your project[3].
*   _"GRPO"_: This refers to "Guiding Response Policy Optimization."
*   _"Instilled"_: Models that have undergone a process to instill specific knowledge or behaviors.

*Recommendation*: Start with an open-source "instruct" or "SFT" model in the 32GB-70GB range. This gives you a solid foundation for medical applications.

**Step-by-Step Training Guide**

*Phase 1: Data Preparation is Key*

1.  *Data Collection*:  You've got years of diagnosis reports â€“ that's great! Make sure you can export them in a usable format (text files, PDFs that can be converted to text, etc.).
2.  *Data Cleaning*: This is *critical*.
    *   _De-identify_: Remove any Protected Health Information (PHI) like patient names, addresses, etc. This is essential for privacy and compliance.
    *   _Standardize_:  Make sure the formatting is consistent.
    *   _Correct Errors_: Fix typos and inconsistencies.
3.  *Data Structuring*:  Format your data into question-answer pairs or instructions and corresponding outputs.  For example:
    *   _Instruction_: "What are the likely causes of chest pain and shortness of breath?"
    *   _Answer_: "Possible causes include myocardial infarction, angina, pneumonia, etc."
4.  *Train/Validation Split*: Divide your data into training (e.g., 80%) and validation (e.g., 20%) sets.  The validation set is used to monitor performance during training and prevent overfitting.

*Phase 2: Setting Up Your Environment*

1.  *Hugging Face Account*: Sign up for a Hugging Face account ([https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/)).
2.  *Install Libraries*: Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install transformers datasets accelerate peft trl bitsandbytes
    ```
3.  *Access to a GPU*: Fine-tuning LLMs requires significant computational power. A GPU (ideally with at least 16GB of VRAM) is highly recommended.  Consider cloud-based options like Google Colab, AWS, or Azure if you don't have a suitable GPU.

*Phase 3: Fine-Tuning the Model*

1.  *Load the Model and Tokenizer*:
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

    model_name = "Model_name_here" # Replace with the actual model name

    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        model_name,
        load_in_8bit=True,
        device_map="auto",
    )
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token #Critical for training
    ```
2.  *Prepare the Dataset*: Use the Hugging Face `datasets` library to load and format your data.
    ```python
    from datasets import Dataset, load_dataset

    # Assuming your data is in a list of dictionaries called 'data'
    dataset = Dataset.from_list(data)

    def tokenize_function(examples):
        return tokenizer(examples["instruction"] + examples["answer"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

    tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
    ```
3.  *Configure Training Parameters*: Use the `transformers` library's `Trainer` or `SFTTrainer` (from `trl`) for fine-tuning[2].  `SFTTrainer` is designed for supervised fine-tuning tasks[2].
    ```python
    from trl import SFTTrainer

    trainer = SFTTrainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
        eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
        dataset_text_field="text", # the name of the column in your dataset that contains the text
        max_seq_length=1024,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        args=TrainingArguments(
            per_device_train_batch_size=4,
            gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
            warmup_ratio=0.1,
            num_train_epochs=1, # Adjust as needed
            learning_rate=2e-5, # Adjust as needed
            fp16=True,
            logging_steps=10,
            output_dir="./results",
            optim="paged_adamw_32bit",
            lr_scheduler_type="linear",
            save_strategy="epoch",
            push_to_hub=True, # Optional:  Push to your Hugging Face Hub
        ),
    )
    ```
4.  *Start Training*:
    ```python
    trainer.train()
    ```
5.  *Evaluate*:  Monitor the validation loss during training.  If the validation loss starts to increase, it indicates overfitting.
6.  *Save Your Model*:
    ```python
    trainer.save_model("./your_trained_model")
    ```

*Phase 4: Testing and Refinement*

1.  *Inference*: Load your fine-tuned model and test it with various prompts relevant to your practice.
    ```python
    from transformers import pipeline

    pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="./your_trained_model", tokenizer=tokenizer)

    prompt = "What is the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with fever, cough, and fatigue?"
    generated_text = pipe(prompt, max_length=500, num_return_sequences=1)
    print(generated_text[0]["generated_text"])
    ```
2.  *Evaluate the Output*:  Carefully review the model's responses.  Are they accurate, relevant, and safe?
3.  *Iterate*:  Based on your evaluation, refine your training data, adjust training parameters, or even try a different base model.  This is an iterative process.

**Important Considerations**

*   _Ethical Implications_: Be mindful of the ethical implications of using LLMs in healthcare.  Always prioritize patient safety and privacy.
*   _Hallucinations_: LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information[3].  Carefully validate the model's output.
*   _Bias_:  Your training data may contain biases that can be reflected in the model's responses.  Be aware of potential biases and take steps to mitigate them.
*   _Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)_:  Consider using RLAIF to further align the model's behavior with your preferences and medical best practices[1].
*   _Medical Leaderboards_: Consult medical LLM leaderboards to help with benchmarking[4].
*   _M-KAT framework_: Consider using the M-KAT framework to enhance the medical professionalism of the models[5].
